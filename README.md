# Student Risk Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application that predicts student academic risk levels using various demographic and academic features. The system helps identify students who may need additional support to succeed academically.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive student risk assessment system using machine learning algorithms. It analyzes multiple factors including academic performance, demographic information, and behavioral patterns to classify students into risk categories.

## ✨ Features

- **Risk Prediction**: Classifies students into High Risk, Medium Risk, or Low Risk categories
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application for easy data input and prediction
- **API Endpoint**: RESTful API for programmatic access to predictions
- **Model Information**: Detailed view of model performance and feature importance
- **Data Processing**: Complete pipeline from raw data to trained models

### API Usage

Send a POST request to `/api/predict` with JSON data:

```python
import requests

data = {
    "G1": 15,
    "G2": 14,
    "failures": 0,
    "studytime": 3,
    "absences": 2,
    "age": 16,
    # ... other features
}

response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict', json=data)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```
